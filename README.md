# ielts-vocabulary

## Description
This project will help you improve your English vocabulary from A1 to B2. It takes the form of a "**yes**" or "**no**" questionnaire, you will be asked if you know the meaning/definition of a word. A "**yes**" will increase your score on the word, and a "**no**" will decrease it.

## Vocabulary words
The vocabulary words are from `https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/external/pdf/wordlists/oxford-3000-5000/The_Oxford_3000_by_CEFR_level.pdf` repo. It contains the 3000 vocabulary words you need to know from levels A1 to B2.

## Next step :
- Thinking about changing the way to process. Instead of asking if "**yes**" or "**no**" the user knows the meaning of a word, it would be better to reveal the meaning and then ask if "**yes**" or "**no** the definition was known.
